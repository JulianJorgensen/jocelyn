You're reading this because you want to know more about me. You want to know where I began and how I ended up here. And it's never easy to pin point a beginning and an end, the best I can do is weave the feelings over the years that tell a story of my life as a human. A woman. A spiritual embodiment. A master student. And... everything in between.

How do you fit a star into a box? That is the shortest summary of my life. 

As a young child I found it challenging to find my place in the greater world. School came rather easy, I was well liked by my peers and my teachers. I was very extroverted socially and had create creativity, I loved performing and show-and-tell. But I always felt like I couldn't be understood, I was a very deep child and asked questions that many adults at the time were probably just beginning to reflect upon. The introvert prevailed in the shadows and the night when I'd just stare at the moon, drawn to it then not knowing it was a long lost home.

I was wise beyond my years, however, I was living in the body and life of a child that created a major paradox. As recounted by a teacher when I was about 11, I asked him, "What is the meaning of life? And, why does my sister hate me?" The two most troublesome questions on my mind then! 

Hard, complex and diverse life lessons were piled upon me since I was a young girl, as if I were to get a crash course on all I learned in my previous lives so I could be as prepared for this one as quickly as possible. My life really felt like a movie, one dramatic scene after the next with the most potent characters filling the set and setting. I was most definitely one of those characters, and during my adolescent years into my early twenties, I was a powerful force. Both a creator and destroyer.

That creative energy in me took on everything that I could at school: soccer, basketball, volleyball, theatre, choir, student council, grad committee, MCing and organizing events... I had many talents and interests. Which sounds pretty great but it lead to so much confusion post graduation. I was exhausted, I didn't want to participate in anything, and I didn't want to socialize with anyone. I was a hermit throughout my 5 years at University. The most challenging part was, I didn't know what I wanted to do or be. This star had too many dimensions and points to neatly fit in the options before me. I felt lost. So I'm good at many things... but I didn't feel I was great at any one thing. I was thankfully guided by my gr.7 teacher who I still had a relationship to go into Communications as SFU. Which in retrospect has refined a natural talent of mine to a masterful degree (although I never got a masters in it!) and I found my passion for social improvement, human connection and freedom by minoring in Sociology. 

But I did mention I was also a destroyer. 

The undercurrent to the joyful, intelligent, bright and promising citizen was a depressed, raging, emotionally traumatized and hurtful individual.
