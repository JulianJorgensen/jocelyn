<p>I have never been one to sit long with titles. I am always changing, ever since I could remember I loved being everything. Random accents would embellish my stories to whoever would hear them. I dressed up often and imagined myself as all the characters I admired. I was inspired by all walks of life. From childhood heroes like Jackie Chan to Elves of LOTR, role models like Homer Simpson (true story) and Spice Girls, professions like International Spy to Actress. My curiosity and genuine interest flowed from one to the next. To me, they were all connected, and I saw myself in everyone. </p>

<p> All of this was wonderful for an imaginative girl, until the hardened edges of the world around me started to close in during my teens. I so deeply wanted to be understood and be accepted, to be valued and to feel purposeful. I started to tuck my star-shaped self into the boxes around me.  And I blended in really well. I was working as a server for 7 years and I finished my bachelors degree in Communications & Sociology, while finding opportunities to travel in the summers. I was swimming straight. For the most part.</p>

<p> Even on the straight and narrow path my deep spirituality and love for the metaphysical, the edge of what we know, busted at the seams of my box-disguise. A 3 month trip to S.E. Asia opened the doors to a new career path, energy work. I became a Shamballa Reiki Master, Crystal Healing Practitioner, Yin Yoga Instructor, A Spiritual Mentor, Workshop Facilitator - I just went straight and narrow on this path for 3 years. It was crazy to begin these sessions in my bedroom to renting an office space. But I was also meeting many obstacles and challenges that were asking me: "Is this how you want to do it?" And something in me started to die.</p>

<p>This title was no longer fitting, this box was starting to fall a part. At 27, I was starting to fear change for the first time. I thought I had my purpose and passion all figured out. I loved being of service, that is why I am here. BUT - I didn't ever consider - maybe not this way. I could not stop the force radiating from inside me that was asking me to trust a new way of being, doing, and living on Earth. </p>

<p> I started to stop, drop and roll away from anything that was not going to make it into the New Earth. I had to release friendships, lovers, family, beliefs, joys, griefs, a business, titles, memories, my dog, and where I've always called home. I was about to get on a perilous voyage to new uncharted territory, deep into myself I've never been. It started during my 5 months in Costa Rica (Oct. 2016) where my eczema symptoms erupted after an Ayahuasca ceremony where I proclaimed I was ready for the next evolution of my being. I couldn't have anticipated the physical pain I would have to experience, like a snake I shed the layers off, one by one. My body was purging from it's cells, pushing the density through my from the core to the surface for me to witness.</p>

<p> .</p>

<p> This is where I am on my journey. And, I hope you'll be supporting my truth, my expression, my creations and my service to you. The best way to do this is to [follow my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/live.deep.lee) and [subscribe to my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHD_5jgPCegnPVZq3cZd-dw), the two platforms I am best at sharing myself on the brightest of days and the darkest of nights with complete authenticity and honesty. </p>

<p>I really hope I'll see you connecting with me because even though I do this because it fulfils my self, it's full of purpose and service to all. Always.</p>

<p>Love,
Jocelyn</p>
