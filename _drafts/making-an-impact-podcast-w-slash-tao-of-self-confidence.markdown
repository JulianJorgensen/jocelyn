I had the pleasure of being interviewed for a podcast called The Tao of Self-Confidence. I got to share my journey with my own self-confidence and what my thoughts are on what it really means to be confident.

Here are some highlights of the talk below:

**Definition of Self Confidence:**
Self confidence is the continuous journey of exploring yourself.

**Life Before the Discovery of Self Confidence:**
As a young child, I was rather shy, but I was always quite confident in myself. As a child many things came easy to me and I received a lot of praise, sometimes in front of other children and that made me very uncomfortable to see someone else’s confidence be stepped on with me as the tool!

**The “AHA” Moment:**
I was a bully in elementary school with no guidance.  There was one boy who I was mean to but one day the same boy confided in me that their family was on welfare.  I realized that the confidence is also something shared. 

I also then realized I can make an impact in the world.

**Her Life After the Discovery of Self Confidence:**
It triggered an ultra confidence for me as a young girl, vowing to be a living example for other women, especially Asian women that we are enough, worthy, powerful and free to follow our hearts and live our own lives.

**The One Self Confidence Tip For the Listener:**
You are not alone, you have a place in this world.  Find a tribe of women who can help you in your journey to self confidence. Through it's ups and downs.
