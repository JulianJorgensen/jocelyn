Sometimes I get very sad. When my body is dry from the crying. My face hollow and empty. Nothing left to give. 

The confusion that arises with this expression can be painful. The varying degrees of pain are experienced on all realms. My body, mind, heart, and spirit. At least it feels so. 

I must write, I must write to give space for this sadness to take shape and form. For it to become clearer to me as to why I am in this moment. 

What is there to be revealed? What am I experiencing? Why must I know? I always want to know... Because when I know I feel like I have control of myself in my life. And is it not true? 

"Ah this is because of __________. Therefore, I can do _______ to change and improve it." 

Are we not responsible for our reality? 

I am writing in deep sadness now. And in deep confusion. Because, I've come to the initial awareness of how often I want to conclude what I am experiencing. I want to bypass the process, I want to use my hyper-awareness to accelerate the process. I want to keep moving to "the next." 

In this awareness the blessing and curse of a paradoxical world covers me like a blanket, and asks me, "Where do you think you're going?" 

"Be. Here. Now."

For the mind, it's so much easier to be something than to be nothing. 

And, being nothing doesn't mean I am not something. 

As soon as there is a nothing, there is a something. 

WHAT? 

I know. It's crazy. So for the last two months or so, this is the paradox in which I am being. Here. Now. 

How does this place fit into the world before me and at large? I have yet to find my answer. 

What I do know is that when I am something, I can bring action to express and represent it, I can create tangible things in the world before me - and in this ability, I feel valued. 

How much of who I think I am decompose to reveal who I am? There's so much thought forming around me. I've given too much responsibility to my mental intelligence in this process of wanting to feel valued.

Remembering the past now, it was in times of pain and suffering that I hear my heart the loudest. It can take on so much, so patient with me. When I am sad, there is no more trained light to shine on the bright side. In the dark I hear the cold, still whisper of truth. Every time, I am grateful for this, for this voice is most authentic and raw - and from there I rise from the depths of the waters into the light.

So, what is the truth now?
