If there is one area of lifestyle that people have yet to jump on a holistic health trend yet, it's our digital health. Humanity is merging and permeated with technology at an ever-increasing rate, and our public and private lives are becoming digitized, taking a whole new life of its own. Our entire well-being is tied to the fate of how we choose to live our lives with the possible miracles and dangers of technology. 

Without diving too deep into 'what-ifs,' I want to highlight the issues we are already currently facing to use as the foundation of how we can create better digital health in our lives.

I am certain that if you have anything that is a computer device with a screen, you are guaranteed to be experiencing some of these symptoms of its exposure physically, psychologically (mental & emotional) and spiritually. 

So let's take a look at some of the most common issues we face today and how we can improve them, we will even do some of them to feel the difference!

• Long sitting hours: poor blood circulation, sedentary lifestyle
• Extensive postures: carpal tunnel syndrome, poked neck
• Staring at bright screen: computer vision syndrome, blue light

PSYCHOLOGICALLY:
• Social Media: increased competition and comparison, false identity, approval
• Private & public sphere: Dissolving of boundaries, lack of thought in consequence
