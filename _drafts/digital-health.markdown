What is digital health?
Digital health is a measure of our ability to have a balanced and conscious lifestyle integrated with technology on a daily basis.

If there is one area of lifestyle that people have yet to jump on a holistic health trend yet, it's our digital health. Humanity is merging and permeated with technology at an ever-increasing rate, and our public and private lives are becoming digitized, taking a whole new life of its own. Our entire well-being is tied to the fate of how we choose to live our lives with the possible miracles and dangers of technology. 

There have been some positively amazing qualities a digital lifestyle has brought humanity, yet it is also obviously evident that it has also brought its equal (if not more) negative qualities to our lives as well. It is not simply the fault of the tech itself, but it is an interrelational give and take between it and us. We create them, they effect us, and we redefine them over and over again. 

The only way to balance this relationship is to be as conscious of our use and motivations of use as much as possible, so that we do not lose ourselves physically, psychologically and spiritually. 

I personally am technology positive, I have high hopes and optimism for its use and elevation of our human evolution. But! In order for one to reach that, we must begin to improve our digital health so we may create such a future.

PHYSICAL:
• Long sitting hours: poor blood circulation, sedentary lifestyle
• Extensive postures: carpal tunnel syndrome, poked neck
• Staring at bright screen: computer vision syndrome, blue light

PSYCHOLOGICALLY:
• Social Media: increased competition and comparison, false identity, approval
• Private & public sphere: Dissolving of boundaries, lack of thought in consequence
• Escapism: Though video games, netflix, mind-less scrolling

SPIRITUALLY:
• Desensitization: See so much on screen, can't relate to reality of problems.
