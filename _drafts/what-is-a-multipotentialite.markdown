Do you ever feel like you have a lot of potentials but none of them really work out?

How many times have you been on the computer because you were supposed to do just this one thing. But along the way your curiosity got the best of you and you became intrigued with the concept of making your own essential oils. So, you dig into it and open multiple tabs to research all about it. You have gone down the rabbit hole and you love it.

Then a few weeks later, after drowning your friends in passionate rants about how awesome it is and how you're totally going to study it or take up a class - you have no interest in it. 

And... maybe you're feeling a little down and out about yourself because it's not the first time you've hyped up a passion - broadcasted it to everyone you know, and your fire went out on it. You feel the projection of, "What are you doing now? When are you going to choose? What happened to the other thing?" You feel like you just can't get it right. 

But what is it that you are trying to get right? What is this pressure you are feeling? What is it that you are trying to fit yourself into? 

I'd been wondering this myself for over two decades. Then I discovered the term: Multipotentialite. 

Growing up I was a quick learner with a natural adaptation in many fields while being relatively good at whatever I picked up (except math - definitely not math!). I was curious and loved experiencing new things and learning about them - and connecting them to completely other things that also interested me. What I learned on my soccer team applied to my performances in plays. I could use the information I absorbed in socials studies class to problem solve in my grad committee. Many teachers told me, "No matter what you choose, you'll be great at it."

But not every blessing comes without a curse. I was cursed with wondering.... well which of these things is the right choice? I was good at many things, but I did not at all feel like I was GREAT at one thing. I was feeling the pressure to conform to the socially valued notion of SPECIALIZATION in career and purpose.

Now, there's nothing wrong with specialization. It's an extremely valuable role in society for someone to be an expert at something. We need those types of people. And I envied those people who just knew what they wanted to be when they grew up, there was no doubt or hesitation.  

But there was no path carved out for someone like me. There wasn't even a category or community I felt like I could be a part of. I didn't feel like I could provide the value I so deeply wanted to offer. Especially being told how great I would be at something.
