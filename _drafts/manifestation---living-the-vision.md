Manifestation is a principle that you already know, simply put it is the process of setting and achieving goals. First, I have never read *The Secret*, so this is my personal take on manifestation. Though from what I have read about it many of its principles are the same in what I believe are apart of successful manifestation. Manifestation encompasses the nuances that are often overlooked or not paid enough attention to during this process. It is not only useful to your cause, but it is also beneficial to your overall wellbeing.

It is a thorough clich&eacute; now to not fulfill New Year resolutions, I heard that to call them goals are more effective now. Whatever you’d like to call them, it is more important that you have the right perspective and appropriate tools to manifest what you want:

&nbsp;

### Soul Aligned Perspective

I believe a big block that comes with manifestation for most people is ensuring that what you desire aligns with your soul and how you contextualize it. For example, wanting far-fetched material goods when you are financially unstable and without a pure intention is a goal that is likely to fail or not provide what you truly wanted/expected. A better perspective is to approach what you want as a vision: to not purely see it as one task to be checked off but something that will affect all aspects of your life and therefore you need to be able to visualize how you will be different physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.

Here is an example scenario: You want to change your body, you look at yourself and want the abs and yogini flexibility. You have bad eating habits and have not had the motivation to go work out for a long time.&nbsp; So, you’d like to manifest that ideal body in your mind & say to yourself, “In 2015, my resolution is to work out more, eat better and get that body I want.” This is a pretty succinct and common goal for the new year but often one will slip back into old habits by Spring.&nbsp;

What I would first change about this is the context of the ideal body and what it is for. Are you wanting to look better because you have self-judgement about your body? Is this ideal body desired through fear and pressure or through the pure intention to get your body in a healthier state? What are your true reasons for wanting this change? And what are social expectations weaving their way into your mind?

Secondly, what are the reasons for not eating better or working out and how exactly are you going to change this in an effective manner so you don’t give up? Have you not been eating well because your self-judgement on your body leads to sadness and food is a comforter? Are you not motivated to work out because you don’t see the results fast enough and you get discouraged by your eating habits which take you back to square one?

These types of questions are a lot to ask yourself when you start your manifestation but this is an important part of the vision, the visualization of what your life will be like overall by this big change. After all, this goal is hard to obtain because it is something that impacts many aspects of your life. &nbsp;So your intentions have to be pure, honest and realistic in order for you to really start to live this change.&nbsp; Switch your perspective from the symptoms you want to change and get to the root cause of why, because the root will affect the fruit of your labour.

Once you do, your desire will change and it may sound something more like this: “In 2015, my resolution is to re-align my perspective and relationship of my physical health by allowing myself to be less judgemental of myself & my body, and have more patience for the changes I’m going to make to my work-outs and eating habits. “ In this more detailed and truthful manner, you touch on your whole self (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual) which when aligned will work together much more efficiently to produce the end results you want through fundamentally changing the cause of the current body issue.

### Appropriate Tools

Once you have the right perspective for your desires, the next step is setting yourself up for success with the appropriate tools for manifestation. Here are some of the most subtle and important principles to keep in mind after you’ve decided and proclaimed to the universe what it is you want to manifest:

Vision /Visualization: As mentioned above it is important to properly contextualize what it is that you want to manifest. After that, the vision and visualization process is a powerful tool to help align yourself (body, heart, mind & soul) to receive what you want. There are various ways you can approach this, writing, speaking/sharing, vision boarding, meditation are some of the few ways you can do this. However you want to visualize, find the medium that will resonate and engage you the most as that is when you will sync with your vision. Doing one of the activities that will leave you with a tangible reminder is helpful because you can look at it on days you are losing sight of your vision.&nbsp; And doing this visualization process on a regular basis will boost your spirits, remind you what you are presently working towards and the true and powerful outcome that will result from this process.

Live as you should: What this means is that after you know what you want to manifest, you’ve asked and visualized this vision & cast this out into the universe, it is time to accept it and start living as you should if it were already here. This is not an aloof or ungrounded step in manifestation, it is actually a very important shift in your everyday life that will allow you to receive your desired goal. As a goal requires work/dedication to get there – this is the effort of manifestation you need to apply in order to fulfill this vision. Also, it is important to keep a positive perspective on your vision, as what you perceive will manifest in your external world.

Using the physical health example, you have to start living as you would if you already had the body you wanted – start to judge yourself less, work on your patience, change your eating and work-out habits appropriately, believe & know the result will come as long as you start to live each day (changing your everyday life habits) to match what you want to receive. This may seem like an obvious when it comes to body changes, but what about something less physical or seemingly in your control. What if you wanted to manifest a relationship (girlfriend/boyfriend, etc.) – Living as you already have it may look something like this: Let go of deadlines of when, improve yourself worth/love so that when you meet the person they will also recognize that in you, purify your intentions of wanting a partner and start to interact with the types of people you want to meet (ie. Girls, boys, etc.) in a genuine way with no expectations so a true romance can bloom when right.

When you start to live your life as if you have it already, when the time is right it will fall into your lap with ease and grace, and you will be more life prepared for this change because you were already living in a frequency that allows it to flourish.

Receive/Gratitude/Reflect: So when it does fall into your lap, you have received what you wanted! It is time to celebrate! Seriously! Celebrating is a great way to show meaningful and genuine appreciation and gratitude for something. You are dedicating time aside for this event in your life and expressing the joy that you have for it in your life, making a very strong acknowledgement of it significance and occurrence. Showing gratitude & receiving is the feminine half of manifestation, while the masculine half is the planning and asking half. Both are important to fulfill as we cannot just ask, receive and not give back in some way; showing gratitude is a way of giving back to the source in which this came from. Humanity’s history has been wrought with “I get what I want” attitude for too long without understanding that it is an alignment of many things coming together, and by showing gratitude you understand it is because it is your dedicated work in alignment that allowed the universe to give it to you. Think of it as a gift given to you by a loved one on Christmas, you already knew what they were giving to you because you asked for it, so you were genuinely extra patient and kind to them, and when they give it to you – even though you knew you were getting it – you gratefully say thank you because you know that ultimately they didn’t have to give it to you, but because you asked&nbsp; & lived accordingly it was gifted to you.

Finally, reflecting on your manifestation is important because it also lets you become aware of how much you changed, how powerful you are when your pure intentions are met with positive action, and it is a great way to learn & improve from for the next manifestation! Take the time to honour your journey, record it, proclaim it, celebrate it! It deserves all the loving acknowledgement you have to give, after all it is because of you it even came to be!

So this year, set yourself up for success, whatever the manifestation may be, and trust that you are a beautiful, loving, kind, and deserving individual of all that you wish for. And that if you are honest and pure in your intentions for yourself, there is nothing you cannot have or change.&nbsp;
