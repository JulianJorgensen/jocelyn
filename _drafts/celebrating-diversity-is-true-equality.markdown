I used to think that equality was this 50/50 - split it down the middle sort of thing. And, that it applied to **everything**. Otherwise how could you be truly equal right?

Have you ever been in a relationship where you guys would repetitively argue over responsibilities in the household ? Who is contributing more by working more? Maybe you split your finances right down the middle, every cheque is divided down to the penny. Unless someone's feeling generous and takes the bill.

Or you're in the other type of relationship where you've both accepted the 50/50 agreement, but find that you are cohabiting with a room mate more than a passionate lover. You can describe the relationship as nice, and you're each other's bffs. 

First things first before you read further - this is only a perspective meant to received by those who want a passionate relationship. Who want to feel a deep attraction to their beloved everyday, where they long for the roles to be clear and the woman is the woman and the man is the man (or whomever is the more masculine/feminine gets to be that).  

You see, people have been living a contradiction of equality when they only define it in quantitative terms. I.e., The idea of half, the same salary, the same number of opportunities - the general neutralization of everything.  And in these numerical terms** it should be equally available to anyone.** But they forget that qualitative matters are more complex and sometimes asks us to allow differences and polarity to be created in order to be balanced, healthy, and whole.

**Equal doesn't mean everything/everyone is the same. And accepting differences does not = inequality. **

It's this neutrality (as I've experienced and come to realize) of the sexes that creates a dispassionate companionship that can lack the attraction and passion we often desire. Of course not for everyone - but anyone who is looking for this needs to understand polarity.

We live in a world of polarities: yin & yang, light & dark, dead & alive, positive & negative, female & male. This is what they mean when they say, **OPPOSITES ATTRACT.**

**So, the shocking truth is: You are a woman. He is a man.** And homegirl, you need to let yourself be the woman/feminine if you want him to step up as a "real man." You gotta let him be the man.

So here's the spark note run down on shifting your energy if you're:

* A ball buster - don't, you're basically literally being the man and that does not attract 

We are all souls yes, but we are also women - and they are also men. And these differences, to me, should be celebrated like the different colours of the rainbow - but we all make up equally beautiful contributions of the rainbow. This is why I feel the last decade or so the LGBT community and gender spectrum has risen hard in our collective consciousness because we are learning to accept our differences yet learn to treat each other with love and respect as the standard of equality.

I just feel the other side of the sword you describe is a choice and not an result of being different. Focusing on differences doesn't mean that I will be treated unfairly or with disrespect, or what we think being "treated unequally" means. Embracing differences, loving and accepting them is what creates the "equality" for me.
