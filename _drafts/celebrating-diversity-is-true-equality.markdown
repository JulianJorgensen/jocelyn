title: Equality is not 50/50

I used to think that equality was this 50/50 - split it down the middle sort of thing. And, that it applied to **everything**. Otherwise how could you be truly equal right?

With feminism, resistance and separation on the rise - I want to shift your perspective and hopefully empower you in the process. 

You see, people have been living a contradiction of equality when they only define it in quantitative terms. I.e., The idea of half, the same salary, the same number of opportunities, the general neutralization of everything.  And in these numerical things it should be equally available to anyone. But they forget that qualitative matters are more complex and sometimes asks us to create differences and polarize in order to be balanced. 

Equal doesn't mean everything/everyone is the same. 

Let's use the work place as an example as it's usually the place with the most discussion in regards to men/women equality.

Of course no body wants to be denied a job or a salary "because they're a woman." That's a really limiting perspective without taking the time to unpack it or expand it. And the common response is to feel like they don't want to be seen "as a woman" but as a "colleague." 

Yet the truth is, they will see you as a woman. And that doesn't create inequality. I would want my colleagues to see me as a woman.  I AM a woman.  and that is a difference that exists in reality - that isn't and shouldn't be a sole deciding factor on a quantitative aspect like my salary nor should that be the focus - but we shouldn't try to make it seem like it doesn't matter (like physical reality matter) or that it isn't there. We just don't have to make a big emphasis on it - but we can celebrate, honour and respect that difference.

Treating each other equally to me now is respecting and honouring our differences. That our differences is not what makes us better or worse (causing inequality) but it's what puts us on an equal playing field (called earth). We all have a right to be here as we are - in all our differences as human beings.

For example - I am Chinese. I am different from you because I am Chinese. This is the truth - that is my race, but I am equal to you because we are of the human race. 

In regards to gender. It's this neutrality (as I've come to realize and really see) of the sexes that creates a dispassionate companionship that can lack the attraction and passion we often desire. Of course not for everyone - but anyone who is looking for this needs to understand polarity.

So, when you are ovulating - you are in a very feminine energy. Even your hormones and pheromones are putting out that you're a female and ready to go. This attracts the very masculine. These "opposites attract" - just like magnets, the polarized energies create attraction. Of course there needs to be a lot of work and evolution in this notion. That's what makes me so excited about tantra - and funny enough I am just finishing up a blog post on "Embracing Your Inner Slut." 

We are all souls yes, but we are also women - and they are also men. And these differences, to me, should be celebrated like the different colours of the rainbow - but we all make up equally beautiful contributions of the rainbow. This is why I feel the last decade or so the LGBT community and gender spectrum has risen hard in our collective consciousness because we are learning to accept our differences yet learn to treat each other with love and respect as the standard of equality.

I just feel the other side of the sword you describe is a choice and not an result of being different. Focusing on differences doesn't mean that I will be treated unfairly or with disrespect, or what we think being "treated unequally" means. Embracing differences, loving and accepting them is what creates the "equality" for me. 

Not being different does not equate "equality" for me. Many things cannot be quantitatively equal, the qualitative matters are complex.  

Anywho, in short this is my current perspective of equality and difference - which I feel is possible and the new evolution, through new learning but I understand it could be very forerunning and counter perspective.
