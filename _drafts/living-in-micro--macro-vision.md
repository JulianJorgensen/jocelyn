When we are looking at our lives, we tend to look at it in two ways: micro and macro vision. One is more about immediacy, details and present situations while the latter is learning how to see the big picture and the connections between micro events. Both are important functions that we should all have, as they provide a well rounded and multi-dimensional perspective of our lives. Each one has it’s own purpose and together they work like the lens of a camera, helping you zoom in and out of life’s moments.

<br>What often happens that leads one to stress is getting stuck in one particular vision. This intense focus or extreme detachment to life events and experiences distorts our vision - it’s like developing near/far-sightedness, one perspective is over-worked and the other is under developed. So first, let us understand what micro and macro vision is, their benefits, their downfalls, and what the significance of both are when we harmoniously integrate them together.
