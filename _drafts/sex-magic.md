The pursuit of happiness raised many questions for myself. Having just completed a course on personality theory, a discussion question that arose was: What is happiness?

What intrigued me the most was the ever engrained and proclaimed pursuit of happiness in our culture, and the notion that it has an absolute end to it. &nbsp;
