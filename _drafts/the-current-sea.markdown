This is soemthing I"m chatting about with right now with my group of virtual goddesses. But try to switch money with love:

The reality of the way the world/society/collective unconscious is right now is there exists a caption or limitation on our exploration of freedom because their's a fear of what may happen if we all just did as we pleased. 

And yes, it is true, there is caution to be had because in reality - not everyone is in a high conscious state for us to just step into that without some sort of PLANNING/STRUCTURE. And there are actually so many opportunities that can be had now that impactfully shift the system into the favour of abundance for all. 

A lot of this is healing the story of money in our mind and creating emotional room for the bounty of abundance available, ie. "I welcome and accept and have birthright to infinite abundance."

So, in reality, the effort doesn't have to be in trying to bend the spoon in the physical realm (matrix reference) the effort must first begin in what we "see" in our minds. 

If we see a system that we must kao tao to then we will bow indefinitely and find some compromise in it. Take what is there, be grateful, keep your head down - it's not so bad. What's there to complain?

But if we see a disfunctional system that can use new systems, then we have room for expansion and new flows of abundance. We have to be a little bit rebellious and shake the machine abit to see where there are loose buttons. Not with the desire to take advantage but create advantages. Then teach others.

So, for example. If you want more abundance. In money, time, space, love, food, security, freedom. First you must see that it is possible, see the system and see the advantages available beyond the naked eye. 

Then, you must proclaim it is truth. Let the universe hear you. Let it give you those opportunities to create them.

Then you must do the work. You must prepare yourself and change your identity. You must become a strong person who can hold that vibration, that abundance, and actually receive it.
