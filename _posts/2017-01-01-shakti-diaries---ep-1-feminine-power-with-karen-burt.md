In this episode, Jocelyn Lee and Karen Burt from Being Tula, share with you how to begin your journey back to your feminine power. Transcription below.

**Jocelyn:**

> We're here at Pachamama. And I've met some amazing women, Karen being one of them.
> <br>
> <br>And I realized some of these dialogues need to happen more with the way things are shifting in the world today. And so, one of the things we wanted to touch on today that we feel like is really important for all women out there, especially women in the west is that feminine touch and that feminine power. Karen take it away!

**Karen:**

> Thank you Jocelyn, thank you so much. It's been a real joy getting to know you over the last few days and I'm really happy to be here talking with you about this really important subject.
> <br>
> <br>My journey was that, like many people, seeing spirituality as the answer realizing at that time because the eastern traditions were the leading spiritual traditions I thought "Okay," if someone can be enlightened, then I know I can be enlightened. So I set myself on that path completely. Meditating everyday. Blissful experiences, realizing that I am Spirit actually. Just inhabiting this body.
> <br>
> <br>And I took it all the way. I took it all the way to the point that started to disassociate with even having a body. From being even female. So I felt like I was just Spirit. Just as much feminine as masculine. And I really came into that beautiful, kind of like, child like spirit place. So don't get me wrong it was beautiful.

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah! Yeah, definitely!

**Karen:**

> Oh it was beautiful, it was blissful. It was, you know, really gorgeous. But I wasn't a woman. I did not in anyway identify myself as a woman. And on that path there was only so far I could go and then, and then the guidance kind of started to… I started to get these messages from my spiritual allies, that there was this new way on the planet.
> <br>
> <br>That things on the planet were changing and there was new energies coming. That the divine feminine was coming in stronger and starting to take a more of a leading role. And, I… various things happened. We only have so much time!

**Jocelyn:**

> Unexplainable things, let's just say that! Mysterious and unexplainable things occurred.

**Karen:**

> It's kind of a long story short!

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah! It' be better if this was an animated cartoon, that would depict it a lot better!

**Karen:**

> Exactly, yeah!
> <br>
> <br>Then something shifted, and I started to locate my spiritual energy inside my body instead of out there. In this kind of like, oneness kind of thing. I started being like, Okay, I'm in here. I'm occupying this body. And, what is this body like? And actually, maybe this body has power!

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah!

**Karen:**

> You know?!
> <br>
> <br>Maybe it's not just this body is just this kind of like this vehicle I'm just dragging around, you know! To like die, and then I'm free again!
> <br>
> <br>Maybe this body has power. And that's when I started to really connect with the divine feminine. And I was suddenly like, "Oh! I like this actually! This is kind of fun!" And it doesn't have to be this passive thing. Being a woman doesn't need to mean that I'm going to be all passive and I'm going to have to take all this flack from men or whatever.
> <br>
> <br>Coming into my womb space, and starting to journey there, starting to see this tremendous power that lay there. I was always kind of a little bit afraid of the lower body. And a lot of women have the same thing. It's kind of messy, and it's dirty, and it's like the kind of "uglier part."

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah, spiritual path or not, there's a disconnect.

**Karen:**

> Yeah, exactly. And you know so much has happened there, where we've allowed experiences to happen that we didn't really want.But we said, "Okay." Because it's be the nice polite girl kind of thing, that's so conditioned into us. But when I really journeyed there, I was like "wow" this part of my body is beautiful. And there's so much power there. And it's been great, is all I can say. It's been really, really great.
> <br>
> <br>Umm, I was telling you the other day how when I did a lot of clearing there and really loving this space and really honouring my body and really honouring my feminine, the next period that I got - my next moon - it was raspberry pink for the first time. Ever. I just felt so happy in my body.
> <br>
> <br>It's really really important right now for all women to come into their feminine power. Like a lot of people know, some people don't know, that the kundalini energy of the planet has now shifted. So for the last 12 to 13 thousand years, it was positioned under the Himalayas so that the divine masculine traditions of the east were kind of leading the spiritual energy of the planet. And now the energy has snaked over to the Andes. Because it's kind of the more feminine ceremonial, heart-led, trusting our intuition, that kind of feminine power of the Earth. Being in touch with the plants, the nature spirits. That's coming through stronger, to the extent that the Dalai Lama was looking for a house a few years ago when I was in Peru. The Dalai Lama was looking for a house there, and the Dalai Lama said that the western woman, it is the western woman that will save the planet.

**Jocelyn:**

> Yes! I remember that too.

**Karen:**

> So, women need to step up and come into their power. And it's like we said earlier, it's not about women leading the way because the men aren't so good or anything like that. It's about us claiming our rightful power as queens beside our kings who wish to serve, and they want to be our heroes.
> <br>
> <br>One thing that's been really important for me is working with my womb. And working with the different aspects of my womb. Because the womb holds a lot of power, the uterus holds a lot of power, the vagina holds a lot of power,   the ovaries. Each aspect of our womanhood holds power, holds meaning, holds healing for us. And, just looking at the ovaries, the right side of our bodies is the masculine and the right side is the feminine. And if you tune into your ovaries as a woman, you'll be able to feel like how "she's" doing and how "he's" doing.

**Jocelyn:**

> That's awesome.

**Karen:**

> And what's happening inside of our own bodies can often be very similar to what is happening outside our lives. And what I found is that it's almost like… So on this side, is our energy that makes things happen. It's like okay, let's bring something about us, like's bring something into being, let's manifest, let's initiate action.

**Jocelyn:**

> Yes.

**Karen:**

> This side, is what we're receiving. It's like we have to be nourished as women, we have to feel that nurturing and we have to feel that beautiful Goddess within us. Feeling all yummy and feminine. And what happens is that when she is fed, when she is getting that nourishment, she then feeds into him. And so then he knows how to act in alignment. And when he's acting in alignment, that feeds back like a loop, back into her. So there's this beautiful system that goes around.
> <br>
> <br>So when she's not being fed, when she is depleted, and we do this all the time as women. Because we work, work, work, work, work, work. You know, children, work, house-duties, like social duties. You know we're in a society were there's not enough emphasis on self love and self nurturing.  So when she's depleted, he's not being fed. And when he's not being fed either he shoots in the wrong direction. His action is out of alignment with the divine plan. And again, it doesn't feed back into her and the whole system is out of balance.
> <br>
> <br>So in relationships as well, it's like we as women have to be strong. We have to be loving ourselves, honouring ourselves, because if we're not honouring ourselves then the man isn't going to honour us either. And everything falls apart from that point on. When we're honouring ourselves he's getting fed by our radiance. By how nurturing and how beautiful we are feeds him. And so then he does the right actions, basically, to serve us and it's a beautiful circle.

**Jocelyn:**

> And, for anyone that doesn't even quite understand this language but we can put into work perspective, just think about what has been dominating the last few years. Is this idea of being the boss lady. Really stepping into a very masculine role and not nourishing that feminine who wants to be caressed, that wants to have that romance. That, you know, ask that of the man but is not asking in the right way because the will is in that personal will. Not the divine will of helping our men raise up to meet that loving queen, rather than the "Beep" queen.

**Karen:**

> Yes! As women we've had these role models of like these examples of women that either out of balance because they are trying to be like men. Which is just daft.

**Jocelyn:**

> Yes. Guilty! Guilty, I know, it's true.

**Karen:**

> Or, there's the passive feminine that she just caves in and that's been a big thing as well. Where women they just become these weak, passive things that they just allow themselves to be dominated. And abused, ultimately.

**Jocelyn:**

> And it's hard things to hear, you know. But when you do the work to go in and you look deep into where that source comes from, that's the source. And it's important for us to recognize the reality of what's happening with us and to get out of that victimhood, the martyrdom, which has been 1000's of years in the making. It's time to get a new script. It's time to get a new script.

**Karen:**

> Definitely! Get with the new program!

**Jocelyn:**

> We have to redefine our way of becoming women.
>
>
> Cause the old way is not necessarily the way that's going to be best for us and the way we interface with the world. You know. And, taking what worked and the traditions, but also having the courage to create new traditions.

**Karen:**

> Yeah, it's a spiral right?  So it's like there's elements that need to be present from the old tribes where they basically - there was a strong sisterhood, womanhood, you know. Have moon time. Women would go and leave the rest of the tribe and they would be together as women and bleed onto the earth and receive the insights for the next month. Then they would pass it on to the men, and the men would then go and carry that out. These beautiful traditions have so much power for us today.
>
>
> And at the same time, it's a new time. We're in a different place in the universe! There are new energies hitting the planet, we're getting kind of galactically expanded. Power increasing within ourselves, our own mastery and it's time for us all to be whole together. And for women to work together and support each other and embodying our true selves. But also for that individuality to come through, the feminine within each of us, within out hearts. "Why am I here? What brings me joy?" How does it feel to be this unique spirit in this unique body and what is it that I'm called to do, moment by moment. And that is very much about following our joy as you said. It's time to make life on Earth fun.

**Jocelyn:**

> YES!

**Karen:**

> And that's how we create paradise on Earth again.

**Jocelyn:**

> YES!

**Karen:**

> Each of us has our own little part to play, like a big diamond and we all have our own little facets. And I really believe that what you're meant to do is the thing that brings you joy.

**Jocelyn:**

> Bringing it all together, is what we both feel is a great way for women to begin going on this path of initiation and discovering their femininity. Yeah….. It's a good one.

**Karen:**

> Gotta make it practical!

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah! Because you know we can talk about it and, yes, it all sounds really great. And there's a knowing but how do we again, put it into reality? Put it into motion?

**Karen:**

> Exactly, it's gotta be practical these days.
> <br>
> <br>There's a lot of things I think women can do. So, one thing is to find a red tent in your area. And if there aren't any, women's circles. To start a women's circle and to start without even really, really knowing what you're doing. But to just start a women's circle, to be like the intention is that we're going to create a sisterhood. Is that we're going to be able to support each other, to live from the heart. And to act with joy and to move towards the things that are nourishing for ourselves, self honouring. So that's what I would say is one thing.
> <br>
> <br>Another thing is to… it's still okay to meditate, you know. And to go out there and to just feel spirit and be the witness. But to also journey inside, inside the body. And to start coming down into this powerful space of the womb. Just really start meeting your body and just self love! Like really checking in more with what is self loving for ourselves. What's going to be nourishing and nurturing on a daily basis.

**Jocelyn:**

> Mhmm… Always easier said than done. Cause I still, you know, have to check in with that all the time. Even though I'm like "Yeah, I'm a woman!"

**Karen:**

> Yeah! Cause otherwise you get complacent, because there's this whole kind of collective river around us which is still moving to the old beat. And it's very easy to get sucked into that.

**Jocelyn:**

> And another thing that just came through for me too is touching on the aspect that when we speak about the feminine and the woman, it doesn't mean that as a woman you might not have a more masculine core or you might have more masculine tendencies and those things.

**Karen:**

> Sure.

**Jocelyn:**

> But for every human, they should be getting in touch with their feminine energy, is what it really comes down to.

**Karen:**

> Yeah, men too.

**Jocelyn:**

> So the essence of what is feminine for me, this is what - I was thinking like, "Woman's circle, that's a good one!" Just getting together and just start sharing. You'll start to see very quickly, how creepily inline you guys all are. You know! It's true! It's like, "Woah, you're going through the same thing? You just cried yesterday too?"  It gets really weird. So that comes really easily.  But also to have the ability to, the awareness of what is "woman" for you. What is "feminine" for, you.

**Karen:**

> Yeah.

**Jocelyn:**

> In the essence of femininity. And find the aspects that speak the most to you. Because, again, we're not putting one tone to femininity.
> <br>
> <br>And that's what Karen was saying, bringing your flavour of femininity forward. So that's a really internal process as well. But, very vital to your journey of knowing what speaks to you. For me, I like singing, I like dancing that makes me feel feminine! I like puttin' my earrings on! I like puttin' my dress on! That makes me feel feminine.
> <br>
> <br>And have fun! This is what we mean, have fun with it. Play around, just discover that feminine part of you.

**Karen:**

> It's an exploration, for sure, to begin with. You have to explore it, explore what your beliefs are. Your limiting beliefs are and what your role models have been of the feminine. What your experiences have been of the feminine and then look for some new examples. Look for some new role models. Look at the Goddesses and archetypes that we've been given throughout mythology from different traditions. Find some new examples to call in.

**Jocelyn:**

> And define for yourself.

**Karen:**

> Yeah, make up your own.

**Jocelyn:**

> Yeah!

**Karen:**

> Just as long as it feels good.

**Jocelyn:**

> Be your own Goddess.

**Karen:**

> Definitely.
> <br>
> <br>I've just started a new social enterprise with two other women. And we Tula Goddess retreats. Actually, all about this and a lot of other stuff on women's issues.
> <br>
> <br>Tula means balance in Sanskrit. It also means tranquility, mountain peak, strength, in various different languages.

**Jocelyn:**

> Beautiful.

**Karen:**

> So it's about be strong, be balanced, be calm, be tranquil, be… yourself.

**Jocelyn:**

> If you are totally interested in Karen's work and her perspectives, and you want to know more, how can we find you Karen?
