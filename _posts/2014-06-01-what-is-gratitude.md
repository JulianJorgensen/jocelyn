excerpt: '"I am grateful for all the miracles and mysteries of life and the lessons
  they provide me; those that vividly present themselves before me as well as those

Often, gratitude is superficially expressed, lacking a depth that keeps it in our heart and mind. For example, only expressing it when receiving something, or being thankful out of fear, and the worst is when you express it whole-heartedly one day and the next it’s gone.

In many major spiritual traditions it is a fundamental aspect to their beliefs and way of living. Gratefulness in this case extends to all dimensions of life, to encompasses all miracles and mysteries of life. How the air we breathe is produced by trees, or how our DNA is only 1.3% different from the Bonobo ape, that we evolved from organisms of ancient oceans, that a mother’s heartbeat can synchronize with her child’s heart only a few feet away, or that gravity has the ability to slow and speed up time. None of these phenomenon occur because it “owes” us anything; it simply just is in the creation of life and we have the ability to be grateful for it.

In the Journal of Clinical Psychology, [Robert A. Emmons & Robin Stern (2013)](http://gallery.mailchimp.com/c616a68c09aae3ea3e536552e/files/112246b3-fe21-4daa-a2df-8b15dac52781.pdf) describes the purpose of gratitude:

> “Its ultimate goal is to reflect back the goodness that one has received by creatively seeking opportunities for giving… [with a] grateful appreciation that one has lived by the grace of [life]… it is knowing the grace by which one lives that is itself a profound spiritual realization” (pg.847).

When described in this way, it doesn’t seem difficult to express gratefulness… what is not mentioned that is imperative to the goal is to be able to appreciate everything; the good and the bad.

We are always comparing our current state to past experiences and future expectations – we are taught to welcome consistency, but seldom are we grateful for spontaneity or change and the blessings they may bring. Consistency and spontaneity have their positive and negatives: one can bring security, while the other brings highlights to life; one can kill us slowly through mundane pattern, while the other can strike one blow so painfully that nothing can be revived. Often, we are so focused on the disruption change creates we cannot imagine seeing anything to be thankful for. However, that is where the lesson of gratitude lies – as Emmons & Stern put it:

> “Losing some aspects of one’s life may lead the person to increase the value they see in other aspects of life” (p.848).

To be truly grateful, it requires you to consciously pay attention to your current negative situation and to see the contributions that have been made to your life (by the situation, yourself, or others) and then expressing it verbally, behaviourally and psychologically.

A great way to habitualize this new thought process is to keep a gratitude journal, below are some comments of its benefits by clients suffering mild depression mentioned in Emmons & Stern’s research (2013, p.853):

* It keeps me in touch with reality out there rather than my constant negative interpretations. I remember that others are there and can be supportive.
  <br>&nbsp;
* Helps me get out of the negative and remember that not all is lost.
  <br>&nbsp;
* I am reminded that there is more to feel good about than to feel bad about.
  <br>&nbsp;
* I stop taking the good in my life for granted and get out of my shell.
  <br>&nbsp;
* I actually FEEL better when I am thinking about all the gifts I have in my life.
  <br>&nbsp;
* Being grateful takes a conscious act of will. It is hard but really worth it.
  <br>&nbsp;
* Writing about good things rather than bad things in my life makes me feel lighter inside.
  <br>&nbsp;
* Gratitude keeps me going in the tough times.


Along with these wonderful realizations, physical benefits include longer sleep, better sleep quality, and increase in physical stamina!

I once thought a gratitude journal was trivial, I thought that I was optimistic and overall a happy enough person that I didn’t need to list the things that I was thankful for. But I gave it a shot anyway. At first it was trivial: “I am thankful for my dad. I am thankful for my mom. I am thankful for my sister,” etc. But as I kept writing I started to realize it was me who was being trivial, I was unable to really let my inner self speak of the things I was really grateful for!

As the pen continued to hit the paper I wrote the one thing that made me realize what this was all about: “I am just thankful that I even came across and learned Shamballa Reiki and Crystal Healing and that now I even get to use it to help people.”

It made me realize that it provided me the answer to the struggle at the time, “I want to help people, but what is my purpose?” I was neglecting to recognize it was right in front of me the whole time and by learning to be grateful my life began to change for the better… So give it a try – even if things are going well! Your life may just get even better!
