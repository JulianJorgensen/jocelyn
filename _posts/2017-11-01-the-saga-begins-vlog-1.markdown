This week I sum up the hard earned and learned lessons this last year, talk about what I'll be doing in India, and how I am so lucky to do all of this. Plus I fall into some rice fields, play some gongs, record a cosmic comedy sketch and save 3 baby ducks! You know - all in a week's work! 

And, so it begins! The first of regular weekly vlogs where I can document all the fun things I get into on my travels and the lessons I learn along the way to share with you.
