Eye-gazing is one of the most powerful ways to disarm your prejudices and judgements about another person, including yourself. In doing so, we can begin embodying a true feeling of oneness and connection.

This video shares an eye-gazing activation I lead that opened up a group of strangers to each other in a deep and unexpected way.  Watch the group progress from crossed arms to warm embraces. 

I lead this interactive workshop on the 2016 Spring Equinox at a conscious gathering in Vancouver, BC.
