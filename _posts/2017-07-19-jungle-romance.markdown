Under the stars. Under the trees. Under the bridge. Under the loose strand of your hair.

I am drawn to your eyes, your piercing stare. I can feel the love between our gaze, suspended in mid air.

Look around, the lush of green. Mother earth invoking our desire for each other. The Shiva, the Shakti, the highest of communion.

In the land of the Gods, Bali, Bali Ma. This primal surge in our bodies leaning ever forward.

Hearts beat, breath quickens, skin is moist to the touch.

Gently now, no one can see us. Reach out and hold my heart in flesh. Supple, round and erect with lust.

What rules are there to nature's creation? Only that one penetrates and one remains open.

The wild is coming. A jungle romance.
