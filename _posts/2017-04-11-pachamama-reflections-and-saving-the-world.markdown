Wisdom gained from the challenges at the beginning of our journey down to Costa Rica, and what the spiritual eco-community is like. Revelations about connecting with people spiritually and the hypocrisy it brought up in myself. And meeting a young woman who gave me hope for the future and how we can best save the world.

Day 5 shot in November 2016 during my stay at Pachamama, a spiritual eco village in Costa Rica.
