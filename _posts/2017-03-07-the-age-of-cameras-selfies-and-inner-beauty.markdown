I love looking at cultural trends as clues into where our collective evolution is going. With every creation in our dualistic world there will always be the "good " and the "bad."

And there are a lot of negative talk out there about millennial culture and the way they perceive and share themselves. And often it's a fear about the new way of doing things, a misunderstanding of what is happening, an inability to empower a situation rather than criticize it. 

As a millennial I wanted to understand why I wanted to get on the camera and share myself yet also felt conflicted with that feeling of appearing narcissistic that was spoken about regarding our generation. 

Why are we so obsessed with ourselves? How often do we have the camera on to take a selfie but just and up looking at ourselves in different angles?

**What does this all mean? \

I was adamant on recording my journeys to show that the culture and path of plant medicine had a beautiful side - inadvertently I became aware of the phenomenon of the camera for our generation with the original intention.

**As I kept observing my behaviour via the camera, I received a download:**

What if this is not narcissism, but the beginning of introspection. What if this is the natural cultural evolution of our generation learning to look at themselves closely, intimately and deeply.

Not everyone will be at the same depth of awareness, but we all know what self-consciousness is. Unfortunately it has a bad reputation - which I feel needs to change. If we can open up this word and embrace this strong paying-of-attention to ourselves **with a purpose** - it can be a great agent for change and personal growth.

We are literally pointing an unbiased eye at us. The camera is the neutral observer watching us, with the powerful ability to show us ourselves as we are. How we choose to be. Capturing every twitch, hesitation, exaggeration, sincerity and beauty.

What I have been recommending for the women I coach is to take the camera/selfie phenomenon deeper and use it as a tool. Just like I have in this video - I ask them to just record their feelings in the moment, looking into the camera. Just start talking. Soon, the "awkwardness" (if there is any for the millennials!) of looking and talking into the camera will fade. \

After they're done, I ask them to watch themselves again. When we allow our speech to flow without restriction, and we observe ourselves after the recording is done, we can pick up on our subconscious and unconscious behaviour, beliefs and habits. From this new perspective we can have more clarity into different aspects of ourselves and make more effective self-improvement.

Often women will tell me how much better they feel when they do this and how much watching themselves have helped them appreciate themselves more. That they often are surprised by their own wisdom and beauty on screen. The more we get used to looking at ourselves, the more comfortable we will be looking deeper into ourselves. And in there are all our answers. In there is our power.

So with the wise spirit of Yonc√©,\*\* "Feel Yo'self."\*\*

**JOURNEYING DISCLAIMER:**

*I am not telling you to go do this - this is simply my experience shared with you.  This was from July 1st (Canada Day), 2015. I was journeying on a magic mushrooms/psilocybin and this was one of the many transmissions I received via this spirit plant. I have been documenting my journeys live because I want to share that when you journey with plant medicine with intention, you can have very beautiful, healing,  applicable and profound experiences. This communion with the spiritual world has been vital for my spiritual evolution, and I have deep reverence for these teachers. There's tons of research into the benefits from a medical perspective. Just go to the MAPS ([Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://http://www.maps.org/)) website to learn more. When we've collectively accepted this gift of the Earth, I will be ready.*
