As much as I love my family & friends back home, I miss BC's nature the most. Especially Vancouver island, where it just calls to my soul.

I've been unfolding a mystical & musical part of myself for over a year now. Some of you may have been watching me sing, some of which are my own songs. 

Having just learned the guitar this last little while, it truly is just an instrument for my Spirit to come through me with wisdom.

The amazing month I spent on Denman Island was a place of pure inspiration and healing. Teaching me my creative nature and process. I hope that you'll feel me in this visual journey I'm sharing with you.

I must admit, I loved watching the myself in all that joy and beauty.
