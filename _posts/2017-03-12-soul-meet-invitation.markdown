> WATCH THE 3 MIN INVITATION VIDEO ABOVE FIRST!

I know you're tired of the dating systems & scenes in Vancouver. It ranges from pathetic, bland, awkward to obscene. You want something deeper, more meaningful, perhaps even profound.

You want a soul connection. Not just the personality you see posted on the screen, or the facades people wear at the party, or the walls of expectations at the set up blind date.

You want a woman to admire your soul and not just your achievements. You want a man to honour your soul not just your body. You want a connection that makes you feel alive.

But have you ever actually felt this? Do you know how to make soul connections? Have you ever been in a situation that makes you feel safe to learn and explore this with no expectations?

If you're still reading - probably not. Most people haven't.

And that's why I'm contacting you personally about this private event. Because I want you to have that, I genuinely and passionately wish this for you. And I'm here to help you SOUL MEET.

**THE SOUL MEET:**

*  May 6th, 2017  -  a 3 hour event starting at 6pm, food \+ beverages provided\
  \(if we have 12\+ people, we'll make it 4 hours.)

* Location is TBA, depends on how many people attend. Will know by April 1st.

* Learn how to confidently open yourself authentically and speak from your soul. In a healthy mix of men & women (max 20 ppl)

* This is a safe & private environment for individuals ready and committed to connecting with others on a soul level

* This isn't soully (pun intended) about meeting a romantic interest, this is about allowing yourself to have deep soul experience - so you can recognize that feeling when you meet someone you are interested in. Man or Woman.

* It's going to be a night of deep interactive action facilitated by Jocelyn and room for organic flow of connection

**BUT HOW MUCH? - Good Question.**

* 1st. I am not intending to profit from this particular event. I sincerely want you to connect with each other and I'm only in Vancouver a short while and want to elevate the way people connect in this city. All while enjoying an amazing event, extra money after renting the space will be used to bring your delicious food and beverages!

* 2nd - This event will be funded by your investment of:

  -  $25/person (currently room for 7 men & 7 women left)

  -   $40/person (after April 1st - fool's day!)

  -   Reservations close on April 30th, 2017

**FINAL DETAILS:**

* You are not going to see who else is attending. I'll keep you guys updated on the total of people and if there's going to be a pause for new women/men so I can keep the attendees as even as possible.


* The space will be dependent on how soon I have the minimum 6 people registered.


* Again, this is for people ready to make the leap and open the doors to meeting yourself and others from the soul level. So it's up to you to take this opportunity or leave it.
