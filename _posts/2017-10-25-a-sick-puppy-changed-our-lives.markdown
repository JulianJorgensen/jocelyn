The Bali breed of dogs used to be highly regarded spiritually and culturally. Over time they've become mostly malnourished and sick street dogs sustaining severe abuse and abandonment. Not all cases are like this but it's a sight that easy to spot driving along the roads. 

BARC for Bali Dogs is a rescue and rehabilitation centre that saves, protects and rehomes the pups they find. And it's a challenging job, I got to see first hand how overwhelmed their facilities are. On an IG story I saw they needed to get some of the young quarantined pups fostered, so I offered to take care of one until he was ready for adoption. We didn't know how much impact this little creature would bring to our lives in just two weeks, he was a highlight of my 5 month stay here in Ubud, Bali. And this is my story of Little Django.
