No matter where I travel, I dream of Ucluelet, BC. It's a small town south of Tofino, with an amazing rainforest in between. I have been going there for over 11 years, and this was the last time I was there.

I was also there alone - which I don't normally get that kind of time to myself. It was a magical experience, as always. There's something about the windswept trees, the black rock shore and mist in the air that takes me home. This is my soul home. The place I will have a home and a retreat to share it's magnificence with you.

Ukee infinitely inspires me and teaches me simple wisdom to live by, so I share a little one with you.
