Bring down those folded arms. Let me see your heart. I know your jaw is clenched because you're afraid of the tears that may come from a breath.

The firey glare tells me you deeply want love and understanding. It's a passionate yearning of your soul.

But I will not meet you the same place you've become expectant of disappointment. I will not harden and create edges between us.

I will smile at you and disarm you with tenderness. I will gently laugh and tell you to come into the circle of my arms. In my embrace I will massage your hurt with the love of the eternal mother in all of us.

And there you will breathe through your softened jaw, the fire in your eyes will be put out by tears and your arms will fall to your sides in surrender. You open like a flower.

Together we will laugh because all you needed was love.
