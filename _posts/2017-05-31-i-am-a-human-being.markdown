More than ever, I remove the words to my being.

I embrace the feminine process of **BECOMING**.

I learn to let **IT BE**.

The emphasis is not on becoming **SOMETHING**.

The point is not to become **SOMEONE**.

The truth is to let **ME BE**.

And.

**THIS BEING IS WHOLE.**

**I AM WHOLE.**

**I AM A HUMAN BEING.**
