*I am a multi-dimensional being living in a human body. As a young girl, wise beyond my years, I was often quite lonesome in my own world. A living juxtaposition of an old soul with a child's body. Remembering at 12 years old, asking my teacher: "What is the meaning of life and why does my sister hate me?" It was a reflection of my deep interest and curiosity of the metaphysical world, and at the same time the innocent humanity that resides in me that so wanted to be loved. These two desires spiralled me down a path that has taught me many lessons, given me exciting stories to share and a colourful in-depth perspective on life and it's workings.&nbsp;*

*Fifteen years later, I am ready to share from my authentic heart and intimate life with you. From the enlightening mysteries explored in the spirit world, the sensual tantric goddess on a mission to [Elevate Sex](www.elevatesex.com), to the shapeshifting aspects of myself as living art.&nbsp;*

*Choose to be inspired by my journey as an observer and watch me carve the path to my destiny through my blog; witness the unfolding of my expressive nature. Or, choose to participate in my journey and work with me as; align with your soul's purpose, create authentic relationships from the heart, and raise your consciousnesses to connect deeply with your life.&nbsp;*

*With deep gratitude & love,*

### Spirit Weaver:

*"I walk the spirit world. I commune with Gaia and the Universe on an intimate level, feeling the pulse of life in every moment. It speaks to me and lights my destiny before me as I heed the call. The experiences and wisdom I have gathered through Coaching, Reiki, Crystal Healing, Plant Medicine Journeys, Yin Yoga, Massage, and Workshops has inspired me to be a portal for others to experience a divine connection with something greater than themselves."&nbsp;*

### Tantrika Goddess:

*After years of sexual experiences that left wounds, scars, pain, fears and a disconnect to this life force energy - I am now open to the bounty and pleasures readily available to me by the grace of the universe. It is our divine birthright to live a pleasurable life, and so I am here to ElevateSex. To see this life force &nbsp;as a healing energy, a source of power, a sacred action and union, and a liberating path to the truth &nbsp;of who we are. I share with you the intimate details of a Tantrika Goddess, seen through my eyes and lived through my heart.*

### Shapeshifting Artist:

*The aspects of my artistry are many, they all want to be seen, heard and shared. There is no single form I take for long, always shapeshifting according to my expression at the moment. I sometimes sing to the moon, I sometimes write songs for my beloved, somedays I freestyle sacred rhymes on nature walks. Other days I may paint the evening away or talk in a foreign accent all day. Perhaps I will dance and perform my heart's expression in the morning, and by the afternoon I have written a comedic skit on my absurd behaviour. &nbsp; Shapeshifting is my artistry.&nbsp;*
